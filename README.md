Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites. It encompasses several disciplines, including:

1. Front-end Development: This involves creating the visible parts of a website that users interact with directly. It typically 
involves languages like HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (behavior).

2. Back-end Development: This focuses on the server-side of web applications. It involves writing code that communicates
with the server, manages databases, and handles the logic behind the scenes. Common languages and frameworks include Python, Ruby,

3. PHP, Node.js, and Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails for frameworks.

4. Full-Stack Development: Full-stack developers work on both the front-end and back-end aspects of a website or application, 
allowing them to handle all aspects of development from server setup to user interface design.

5. Web Design: While not strictly development, web design involves creating the look and feel of a website, including layout,
color schemes, typography, and user experience (UX) design principles.

6. Mobile Responsive Design: Ensures that websites function properly on various devices and screen sizes, such as smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

7. Version Control/Git: Web development projects often use version control systems like Git to manage code changes and collaborate with team members.

Overall, web development encompasses a range of skills and technologies aimed at creating functional,
visually appealing, and user-friendly websites and web applications.
